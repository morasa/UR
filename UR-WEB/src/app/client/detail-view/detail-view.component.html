                        <p>Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in
                             America by making it illegal to transfer money to them through any US bank
                             or payment system. As a result of this law, most of the popular online
                             casino networks such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States.
                             Overnight, online casino players found themselves being chased by the
                             Federal government. But, after a fortnight, the online casino industry came
                             up with a solution and new online casinos started taking root. These began
                             to operate under a different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered
                             the transfer of money to and from them legal. A major part of this was
                             enlisting electronic banking systems that would accept this new
                             clarification and start doing business with me. Listed in this article are
                             the electronic banking systems that accept players from the United States
                             that wish to play in online casinos.</p>
